# GreedyAlgorithms_CPP
This repository demonstrates a specific greedy algorithm in C++. Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. The file implements a problem-solving approach that highlights the efficiency and practicality of greedy methods, such as task scheduling, resource allocation.
